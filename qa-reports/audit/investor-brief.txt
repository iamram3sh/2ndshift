2NDSHIFT PRODUCT AUDIT - INVESTOR BRIEF

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
2ndShift demonstrates solid core functionality with working role separation, authentication, and category pages. However, critical UX issues block conversion: password reset returns 404 (users cannot recover accounts), homepage CTAs don't navigate properly (breaks browser history/SEO), and commission transparency is missing. Quick fixes (10 hours) can resolve P0 issues.

KEY FINDINGS:
✅ STRENGTHS: Role-based content switching works, category pages functional, pricing in INR, authentication flow operational, JWT_SECRET configured.

🚨 CRITICAL (P0): Password reset broken (404) - conversion blocker. Homepage CTAs change content but don't navigate - breaks expectations, SEO, deep linking.

⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (P1): Missing breadcrumbs on category pages, contradictory low-value categories in filters, commission not displayed on job cards, CTA spacing needs verification.

RECOMMENDATION: 
GO with 72-hour remediation window. Core product works but UX friction will impact conversion. Fix P0 issues immediately (password reset, navigation), then address P1 items. Estimated 24-48 hours to production-ready state.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Conversion Risk: HIGH (password reset broken, navigation issues)
- Trust Risk: MEDIUM (missing commission transparency)
- Product-Market Fit Risk: LOW (minor category filter inconsistency)
