**About Section Template:**
```
I'm building 2ndShift - the freelance platform that actually protects freelancers.

Why? Because I was tired of seeing:
→ Freelancers not getting paid on time
→ Clients worried about TDS/GST compliance
→ No one knowing if a client is trustworthy

So I built a platform where:
✅ Payments are secured in escrow
✅ TDS is calculated automatically
✅ Workers can rate clients (not just the other way around)
✅ You can access earned money early (EarlyPay)

Currently onboarding our first 100 users in Bangalore.

DM me "INVITE" if you want early access.

```

**Wednesday - Behind the Scenes**

```

### Part 3: DM Outreach Templates

#### For WORKERS (Freelancers/Developers):

**Connection Request Note (300 chars max):**
```
Hey [First Name]! Saw you're a [role] in [city]. Building something for Indian freelancers - would love your feedback. Mind connecting?
```

**Follow-up DM (After they accept):**
```
Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting!

Quick question - how do you currently handle TDS when working with clients? It's something I hear a lot of freelancers struggle with.

I'm building 2ndShift - a platform that handles TDS automatically, plus lets you see client ratings before accepting work (think: do they pay on time?).

We're invite-only right now. Want early access? Happy to set you up with a free Pro account.

No pressure either way - just thought it might be relevant to you!
```

**If they're interested:**
```
Awesome! Here's what I'll do:

1. I'll send you the invite link
2. You create a profile (takes 2 mins)
3. I'll personally match you with your first project

Sound good? Here's the link: [2ndshift.in/register?ref=linkedin]

Also - any feedback you have would be super valuable since we're early stage!
```

#### For CLIENTS (Founders/CTOs/Hiring Managers):

**Connection Request Note:**
```
Hey [First Name]! Saw [Company] is growing. Built something that makes hiring freelancers tax-compliant. Would love to share.
```

**Follow-up DM:**
```
Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting!

Quick question - when you hire freelancers, who handles the TDS compliance? 

I ask because we built 2ndShift to solve exactly this:
→ Automatic TDS deduction (Section 194C compliant)
→ GST invoicing handled
→ Escrow protection (pay only when satisfied)
→ Verified, rated professionals

We're onboarding our first 50 companies. Zero platform fee for 3 months.

Worth a quick look? I can give you a personal walkthrough.
```

**If they're interested:**
```
Perfect! Let me make this easy:

1. I'll create your company account personally
2. Share exactly what role you're hiring for
3. I'll send you 3 hand-picked matches within 24 hours

What's the first role you'd want to fill?

(Also - if it doesn't work out, no obligation at all. Just want your honest feedback!)
```

## 🔥 Advanced LinkedIn Hacks

### Hack 1: Comment Strategy
```
Don't just post. Comment on BIG accounts:

→ Find: Indian tech influencers with 50k+ followers

→ Your profile gets seen by their audience
```

**Accounts to follow & engage with:**
- Ankur Warikoo
- Kunal Shah

### Hack 2: LinkedIn Polls
```
Polls get 3x more engagement. Examples:

"As a freelancer, what's your biggest pain point?"
○ Finding clients
○ Getting paid on time
○ Tax compliance
○ Rate negotiation

(Results = market research + engagement)
```

### Hack 3: Carousel Posts
```
Carousels get saved & shared. Create:

"10 Red Flags When Evaluating a Freelance Client"
"How TDS Works for Freelancers (Visual Guide)"
"My Journey Building 2ndShift (Week 1-4)"

Use Canva - free templates available
```

### Hack 4: LinkedIn Newsletter

```

→ Exponential reach
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't spam** - Quality > Quantity in DMs
2. **Don't sell immediately** - Build relationship first
3. **Don't use automation tools** - LinkedIn detects & bans
4. **Don't post and ghost** - Engage with comments
5. **Don't copy-paste same DM** - Personalize each one

A freelance platform built specifically for India.

What's different?

Why did I build this?
[Your personal story - 2-3 lines]

```

### Problem-Focused Post:
```
Freelancers lose ₹2.3 lakh every year.

Not because of bad work.
Not because of fewer projects.

Because of:
→ Late payments (avg 45 days delay)
→ Scope creep with no extra pay
→ Clients who disappear
→ TDS miscalculations

The system is broken.

That's why I'm building 2ndShift.

Where payments are in escrow before work starts.
Where you can see if a client pays on time.
Where TDS is calculated automatically.

### Value Post (No Selling):
```
How TDS works for freelancers (simple explanation):

If you earn > ₹30,000 from one client:
→ They must deduct TDS (1-2%)
→ They deposit to govt
→ You get Form 16A
→ You claim credit when filing ITR

If they DON'T deduct:
→ They're liable (not you)
→ But you might face scrutiny

Pro tip: Always ask for Form 16A.

Most freelancers don't know this.
Now you do.

Save this for tax season 📌
